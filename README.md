After coming back to the project after a week off, a lot of relearning and reevaluating the code then a total rework using some code that worked from original as well as cleaning up and creating a better flow.  
Learned to:
create an array and select a random string from it
create working conditional statements
use comparisons within the conditional statements
how to debug my own code as well as to start over if need to
how to increment and return the value after
